# Project plan

## Whats broke as of 23-11-09

#### Map is flickering

Map is flickering and reloading each time.
Solution idea: Try rendering the map and the animation client side using the plotly/leaflet leafletProxy: http://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/shiny.html DONE

gganimate + maps for easier gif export?

#### Implement the shares instead of absolutes for Aggregated tab

Activities and EC

#### Shiny input pane doesn't resize properly on different screen/window sizes

#### Rewrite description and get faccccs

PACT 1.0 wer? wann?

Anleitung auf subpage, nicht landing page

Landing page mit kurzer Vorstellung der Features, Logos, meinen Socials und dem Link zu Projekt

#### Data coverage tab layout

~~has an absolute value for centering? Or only fails to resize in R-Studio Browser pane?~~

Move to different subpage DONE

Status: seems like its a problem with DataTable output being fixed width, and adjusting to full page once when loading

## Functionalities to add (optional)

#### Data and graphic export for all ggplot objects

works in plotly: [R Shiny: export plot as png/jpg - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40717911/r-shiny-export-plot-as-png-jpg)

--> test in safe environment/branch

Download data via downloadHandler and button, dataset is (reactively) already in existence and can be easily downloaded

#### Remove Engagement Categories - Mission - All

Too clustered DONE

#### GIF export for the map

gganimate + maps for easier gif export?

#### Labeling options for mission groups and activity sets

In dynamic UI as extra field that gets added along the selection field
--> possible to add groups of inputs at once?

#### Rethink the usage of Engagement Categories plotting

As long as no concrete research questions are being asked, the current setup seems satisfactory

## Mini things

- [ ] adapt colors for icons in map to final theme

- [ ] publish to shinyapps

- [ ] add correct info on PACT 1 in "About"

- [ ] Add another example (Disarmament and Demobilization, early missions vs late missions, Activities - Aggregated and EC - Aggregated/Missions)
