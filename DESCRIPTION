Description:
    The app offers an interactive visualization of newly collected data on United
    Nations Peacekeeping Operations (PKO). The Peacekeeping Activity (PACT) data
    was collected using Secretary-General reports and includes 39 distinct mandated
    activities recorded finely over six different engagement categories. The PACT
    dataset covers 40 missions from 1989 to 2018. Visualizations include a modular
    plot creation that allows useers to customize grouping of missions and aggregation
    of activities to fit their research agenda. Map visualizations show the spatial
    implementation of activities in mission countries over the years.
